# Nothing Is Neutral: A Collection of Thoughts On Design
This project is a responsive digital "book" that brings together a curated selection of design readings that share a similar point of view that design is never neutral. Each reading explores how design is influcenced by systems, emotion and power and how designers must recognize the intentions behind every choice. 
# Concepts & Themes
The three featured articles address different but interconnected ideas:
Gradients - explores how gradients serve as a visual language of emotion, feeling and cultural mood in design
There Is No Such Thing As Neutral Graphic Design- challenges the myth of neutrality, arguing that all design is shaped by power, perspective and privilege
On Design Thinking - critiques the industry's universal design processes and flaws within the system itself
Collectively, these reading highlight the tensions between feeling, thinking, systems vs. individuality and order vs. disruption to reflect how designers navigate the grid while sometimes needing to break it entirely.
# Visual and Interaction Design
To reflect the theme of challenging the structure or "breaking the grid", the layout uses linework as a core motif for bending, breaking, and guiding structure across pages. 
Additional design features include:
Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile
Consistent Typographic hiearchy with broken lines in headings and throughout design 
Accessible sans serif body type for readability
Blockquotes pulled from the articles to highlight ideas within each reading
This project follows the assignment constraint of only one image and one svg that could be repeatable to reinforce cretaive problem-solving within limitation.

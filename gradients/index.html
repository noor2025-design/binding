                What it is: A digital or print effect where one color fades into another. Typically rendered in soft or
                pastel tones.
            </p>

            <p>
                Where it is: Gradients are seemingly everywhere in media and marketing. They are part of a suite of
                Facebook status backdrops introduced in 2017 and the branding for the New York Times’ popular podcast
                The Daily, which displays a yellow to blue gradient.

            <p>
                Gradients have taken over Coachella’s app and website (if you watch carefully, the colors shift). Ally’s
                billboard in A Star Is Born is a full-on gradient, and so was the branding for the Oscars ceremony that
                recognized Lady Gaga.
            </p>

            <p>
                On Instagram, they provide a product backdrop for popular Korean beauty brand Glow, and have been
                embraced by indie magazines Gossamer and Anxy — both designed by Berkeley studio Anagraph.

                    "Gradients are a visual manifestation of all of these different spectrums that we live on"
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                On the luxury front, Brooklyn wallpaper company Calico has released an entire collection of gradient
                wallpapers called Aurora. Meanwhile, Spanish fashion house Loewe has introduced a version of their
                trendy Elephant bag in a spectrum of pink to yellow.
            </p>


            <p>
                Are gradients drinkable? Heck yes, they are. Seltzer startup Recess has gone all-in on gradients in
                their branding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why you’re seeing it everywhere: Gradients are the confluence of three different trends: Light and Space
                art, vaporwave, and bisexual lighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the art and design world, Light and Space — developed in the 1960s and ’70s — has been experiencing a
                revival thanks to its Instagramability. Light and Space pioneer James Turrell has been embraced by
                celebrities like Beyoncé, Drake, and Kanye West. Drake’s Hotline Bling video was inspired by Turrell’s
                light-infused rooms called Ganzfelds. The Kardashian-Jenner-West crew posted an Instagram in front of
                one of Turrell’s works in Los Angeles. (I was yelled at by security for taking a picture there but it’s
                fine.)
            </p>
            <div class="blockquote-vertical-line"></div>
        
            <blockquote id="second-blockquote">
                <p>
                    “Before, I think we lived in a binary world. Gradients are a very modern representation of the
                    world.”
                </p>

            <div class="blockquote-vertical-line"></div>
            <p>
                James Turrell’s works come with a warning because the visitor quickly loses all depth perception. Soft
                gradients are alluring because they cut through the noise of social media, but they also are
                disorienting. The Twitter bot soft landscapes operates on a similar principle, but some days the
                landscape all but disappears.
            </p>

                “It’s nice to see calming things amongst all of the social ramifications of Instagram,” says Rion Harmon
                of Day Job, the design firm of record for Recess. Harmon compares the Recess branding to a sunset so
                beautiful you can’t help but stare (or take a picture) however busy you are. Changes to the sky are even
                more pronounced in Los Angeles, where Harmon’s studio is now based. “The quality of light in LA is
                something miraculous,” he says. The Light and Space movement was also started in Southern California,
                and it’s in the DNA of Coachella.

            Gradients might be a manifestation of longing for sunshine and surf. But they also belong to the placeless digital citizen. 1980s and ’90s kids may remember messing around in Microsoft Paint and Powerpoint as a child, filling in shapes with these same gradients. It’s no surprise that this design effect is part of the technological nostalgia that fuels the vaporwave movement.

                Vaporwave is a musical and aesthetic movement (started in the early 2010s) that spliced ambient music,
                advertising, and imagery from when the internet started. Gradient artwork shared by the clothing brand
                Public Space is vaporwave. So is this meme posted by direct-to-consumer health startup Hers.

				What does it mean to design “normal” things for “normal” people? Western society defines certain
				individuals and communities as average and ordinary, while everyone else is something other. People
				living inside the norm bubble often don’t recognize their own special status, because norms aren’t
				supposed to be special. Synonyms for the word normal include standard, average, typical, and ordinary.
				Norms are invisible, becoming present only when they rub up against difference.
			</p>


			<p>
				Graphic designers are in the norm business. We employ legible fonts and familiar interface conventions
				in order to churn out seemingly neutral, user-friendly messages. We use grids, hierarchies, and tasteful
				type pairings to unify publications and websites. We produce brand standards and corporate identity
				manuals to regulate the public image of companies and institutions. Each year, we harvest a fresh crop
				of sans serif typefaces claiming to deliver content in anonymous, trouble-free text blocks. It’s
				Helvetica’s world. We just live in it.

			<p>
				Norms appear throughout design culture. Uniforms and road signs are norms. Icons and emoji are norms.
				Style sheets, templates, and content management systems are norms. Social media interfaces are norms. At
				its core, typography is a norm, invented to reproduce text in a consistent, error-free manner. The rules
				of writing and typography encompass grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and the correct use
				of spaces and dashes.

				People use graphic design to study and transform social relationships as well as visual ones. The words
				and concepts we use to talk about design—in both normative and disruptive terms—also ripple through the
				critical writing about race and feminism. Design is a tool for diagramming and exposing structures of
				power.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 1920s, designers in Europe argued that cubic buildings, sans serif typefaces, photographic
				images, and functional products could be useful and relevant to people across nationalities and income
				groups. Such seemingly neutral forms resisted the nationalist and fascist ideologies that pitted groups
				against each other. Despite modernism’s egalitarian ideals, however, the concept of universal or
				transnational design solutions presumed a male, Western European subject.
			</p>

				According to poet and activist Audre Lorde, the “mythical norm” is what a given society understands to
				be generically human. Writing from the perspective of a Black queer woman, Lorde noted that the norm in
				the US is typically “white, thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian, and financially secure.” The
				mythical norm is an artifact of White supremacy, upheld by racism and oppression. Lorde writes, “As
				white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define woman in terms of their own
				experience alone, then women of color become ‘other,’ the outsider whose experience and tradition is too
				‘alien’ to comprehend.” White women are complicit in preserving the normative system, which inflicts
				ongoing violence—physical, psychological, and economic—on Black people and people of color.
			</p>
			<p>
				Exclusion from the protective bubble of normativity leads to varying degrees of oppression or
				inequality. People who embody some or all aspects of the norm tend to treat their ostensibly typical
				attributes as neutral, invisible, or nonexistent. Being normal seems natural—not a special privilege.
				It’s easy to say “I don’t see race” when you live inside the bubble of Whiteness.

			<p>
				Writers and thinkers can use the tools of graphic design to study and change social relationships. The
				words and concepts we use to talk about design ripple through the critical writing about race and
				feminism. Terms like axis, intersection, and orientation are familiar to graphic designers. Writers and
				philosophers use these terms too, creating spatial metaphors for concepts like racism, sexuality, and
				gender. Spatial ideas such as “margin/center” help people create vivid mental pictures of dominance.
				These concepts prompt readers and listeners to construct diagrams in the gray matter of the mind. White
				savior narratives are told from the perspective of White people who become enlightened and help improve
				the lives of people in marginal groups. Such narratives are said to “center Whiteness,” a process of
				erasing the margins and focusing on the emotional needs and seemingly heroic actions of the dominant
				group.

				Design is normative, but it can also be transformative. Binary oppositions lure the mind with their
				shiny, neatly defined polarities. Just one of many alternative models is the spectrum, which contains
				endless shades of difference between opposing endpoints. Intersections, twisting paths, and mixed
				ecologies push beyond the either/or structure of binary categories.
